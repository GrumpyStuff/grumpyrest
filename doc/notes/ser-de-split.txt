split interfaces
only split implementations if behavior is different (boolean: no, list: maybe)
    need separate supportsType for ser/de: supportsTypeForSerialization, supportsTypeForDeserialization,
    otherwise adapters like List MUST always be split
record adapter should not be split -> too complex, no gain
    records can be genreic too, like lists, so this means we need the above split for supports* anyway
    therefore, shared engine and registry
        if there is a special need to use distinct registries for ser/de, just use two of them. Who cares that
        they have methods that won't be used in that case.
