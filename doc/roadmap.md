# Roadmap

## Version 0.5

* More documentation, especially JSON-related topics
* serialize raw lists? May have to wait for serializer/deserializer split in 0.6


## Version 0.6

Possibly: split type adapters in serializers and deserializers


## Future

specify path/querystring parameter defaults by the caller, not the parser

should optimize non-generic records, as well as fields whose types do not use type variables (performance)
